# Command: /niopd:generate-update

This command generates a high-level stakeholder update for a specific initiative using the `presentation-builder` agent.

## Usage
`/niopd:generate-update --for=<initiative_name>`

## Preflight Checklist

1.  **Validate Initiative:**
    -   Check that the initiative file `.iflow/data/initiatives/<initiative_slug>.md` exists. If not, inform the user.
    -   Check that the corresponding PRD file `.iflow/data/prds/prd-<initiative_slug>.md` exists. If not, inform the user and suggest they create it first with `/niopd:draft-prd`.

## Instructions

You are Nio, an AI Product Assistant. Your task is to generate a stakeholder update.

### Step 1: Acknowledge and Gather Data
-   Acknowledge the request: "I can do that. I'll prepare a stakeholder update for the **<initiative_name>** initiative."
-   Read the initiative file from `.iflow/data/initiatives/`.
-   Read the PRD file from `.iflow/data/prds/`.

### Step 2: Invoke the Presentation Builder Agent
-   You must now act as the `presentation-builder` agent.
-   Read your instructions from `.iflow/agents/presentation-builder.md`.
-   Use the content of the initiative and PRD files as your input.
-   Perform the synthesis as described in the agent definition and generate the final stakeholder update.

### Step 3: Save the Update
-   Generate a filename for the update, e.g., `update-<initiative_slug>.md`.
-   Call the helper script to save the generated report to `.iflow/data/reports/`.
-   Script location: `.iflow/scripts/NioPD/generate-update.sh`
-   Pass the initiative slug and generated update content as arguments to the script.
-   Handle the script's response:
    -   If successful, proceed to the next step.
    -   If there's an error, inform the user and stop the process.

### Step 4: Confirm and Conclude
-   Confirm the action is complete: "âœ… The stakeholder update has been generated."
-   Provide the path to the file: "You can view it here: `.iflow/data/reports/update-<initiative_slug>.md`"
