# Command: /pd:summarize-feedback

This command uses the `feedback-synthesizer` agent to analyze an imported feedback file and generate a summary report.

## Usage
`/pd:summarize-feedback --from=<feedback_filename> --for=<initiative_name>`

## Preflight Checklist

1.  **Validate Inputs:**
    -   Ensure both `--from` and `--for` arguments are provided.
    -   If missing, ask the user for the required information.

2.  **Check Feedback File:**
    -   The `--from` path should be a filename inside `.iflow/data/feedback-sources/`.
    -   Verify that the file `.iflow/data/feedback-sources/<feedback_filename>` exists.
    -   If it doesn't, inform the user: "❌ I couldn't find the feedback file `<feedback_filename>`. Please check the name or import it first with `/pd:import-feedback`."
