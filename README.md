# NioPD: The AI-Powered Product Management Assistant

NioPD is a collection of **Claude Code workflows**, designed specifically to streamline the product management lifecycle. As an AI-powered system, it helps Product Managers turn raw ideas, messy feedback, and complex data into structured, actionable plans, freeing them up to focus on strategy and users.

## The Challenge for PMs

Product Managers today are drowning in data and administrative work:
- **Unstructured Feedback:** Juggling notes from Slack, Intercom, surveys, and user interviews.
- **Constant Research:** Manually tracking competitors, market trends, and data insights.
- **Endless Documentation:** Constantly writing and updating PRDs, roadmaps, and stakeholder reports.

NioPD is designed to automate this "work about work" so you can focus on what matters.

## The NioPD Workflow

NioPD guides you through a structured, repeatable process to take ideas from concept to a well-defined and launched feature.

## What Makes NioPD Different?

| Traditional PM Tooling | NioPD |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| Manual data synthesis | **AI-powered feedback & data analysis** |
| Manual market research | **Automated competitor & trend reports** |
| Writing docs from scratch | **Automated PRD & report drafting** |
| Static, hard-to-update roadmaps | **Dynamic roadmaps from your plans** |

## Get Started Now

NioPD is a file-based system that runs within a local clone of its repository.

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/8421bit/NioPD.git
    cd NioPD
    ```

2.  **Explore the system**:
    The core of the NioPD system is contained within the `NioPD/.iflow` directory. You can interact with the system by issuing `/pd:` commands to a compatible AI agent (like me).

3.  **Start your first initiative**:
    ```
    /pd:new-initiative "My First Feature"
    ```

## System Architecture

NioPD is a self-contained system. The user-facing documentation lives in the `NioPD/` directory, while the core system logic lives inside `NioPD/.iflow/`.

```

### Helper Scripts

#### `new-initiative.sh`
A bash script located at `.iflow/scripts/new-initiative.sh` that provides a command-line interface for creating new initiative files. This script is used internally by the `/pd:new-initiative` command.

**Usage:**
```bash
./new-initiative.sh <file-slug> "<file-content>"
```

**Purpose:**
- Validates input parameters
- Creates initiative files in the `.iflow/data/initiatives/` directory
- Provides success/error feedback
- Supports content with special characters through proper escaping

## Acknowledgments

NioPD was inspired by the innovative work done in the [Claude Code PM](https://github.com/automazeio/ccpm) project. We extend our gratitude to the creators and contributors of that project for their pioneering approach to AI-powered product management workflows.

While NioPD has evolved in its own direction with unique features and capabilities, the foundational concepts and vision from Claude Code PM have been instrumental in shaping this system.
